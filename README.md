# databases-group-proj
Repo containing relevant data for the COMP 3380 group project. The chosen dataset present in this repo is F1 World Championship Series across 70-ish years.

## Meeting 1: 09/16/25

* Narrowed choice of dataset down to F1 World Championship or Spotify App Usage.
* Concluded that we would ask Pazdor questions regarding a good selection for a dataset.

## Meeting 2: 09/23/25
---

* Concluded that submissions of group tasks would be distributed among group members in rotation Jatinder -> Ayesha -> KC.
* Prior to the next meeting, everyone should try and come up with a draft for the ER diagram of our dataset. It will be difficult given the size of the set, so don't stress if you can't get a complete diagram drafted.
* Jatinder presented his draft of the dataset summary. Ayesha recommended some potential revisions for the dataset summary.
* GitHub Repo was created.

## Meeting 3: 10/02/25
